change criminal transactions very much.<br /><br />Terrorists and others are using money transfer network such as the hawala or funneling money through non-profits.  The only thing that would change is the government&#039;s ability to monitor the transactions.  Anonymous payment methods may not even affect the government&#039;s ability to effectively monitor these transactions as the government is primarily using network analysis techniques anyways.  The identity of the people do not matter so much as their network of relationships.<br /><br />Government control and can tax the point of sale.  A Walmart could reduce its taxes to the government by not reporting sales and taking money out of the cashdrawer and righting off the sold inventory, but that does not work at scale.  Only small cash businesses such as pizzerias and laundromats are able to do this without suffering fines and retribution by federal government.<br /><br />Bribery would be as easy with anonymous digital currency as it is with cash.  However we would only see kickbacks transition from being informal to formal relationships.  The government&#039;s ability to regulate &#039;political economy&#039; would be decreased.  You could argue whether this is good or bad for the economy.  You could argue that our current system privileges those with political connection<wbr />s and backrub relationships and excludes the masses from participating in the political economy.  Legalized or deniable bribery may increase scrutiny on public offices and subject them to greater monitoring and oversight, which may be a net improvement over the current system of implicit bribes and no transparency or oversight.<br /><br />We are actually better at enforcing payroll tax compliance at large cash businesses like Walmart (where many consumer do not have credit cards and bank accounts) than we are about using oversight to detect and regulate unlawful &#039;political economy&#039; transactions such as bribery.<br /><br />The government also has systems in place for collecting payroll taxes.  These systems are effective, despite the incentive of the employer and employee to lower reported wages (circumventing payroll taxes) and pay the employee directly (&#039;under the table&#039;), circumventing government imposed transaction fees (taxes).  This type of circumvention only happens in small cash businesses, but not at places such as Walmart.<br /><br />As the government controls the point of sale and is able to collect payroll taxes and sales taxes, its likely the the government&#039;s revenue would not be impacted by anonymous currency to a greater extent than it is by the usage of cash.  In fact, the anonymous digital cash transactions may be easier to monitor for the government.  It can mandate businesses use reporting devices and that businesses receive revenue and pay employees from government controlled or approved accounts.  The switch to digital currency and elimination of cash would improve government revenue for these activities, compared to transactions where cash is used.<br /><br />Where the government would lose tax revenue to evasion, is in the provision of online services, digital goods and investment instruments.  Online service providers (PHP programmers from India/China, iPhone application developers, web-designers) can receive revenue anonymously and c<wbr />ircumvent IRS reporting requirements, with the person controlling the account in a position to deny control of the account and avoid recognition of the revenue.  This is however no different than having an online businesses today owned by a bearer bond IBC which has puppet directors in another foreign country and which provides full deniability for the controller of the back accounts of the corporation.  Anonymous banking would only make these transactions easier, although it is harder to imagine that it could possibly be easier to do than it already is, when you consider the existing system.<br /><br />If you are very rich, there are better ways of creating intergenerational wealth and avoiding taxation, which are extremely effective.  For instance, most equity in Israel and many European countries is controlled by a small number of families.  They do not own the companies directly, but have controlling interests in companies which control these companies.   Less than 20 family control about over 30% of the equity in Israel&#039;s public traded companies, through controlling interests.<br /><br />What use is 30 billion dollars if you cannot spend it?  It is much better to have a dual class share structure, where one class of shares has 20 votes to the common share.  A class of shareholders controlling 5% of market-cap controls the company.  Also, no capital gains are paid until shares are sold off.  When they are sold, the seller pays 15% capital gains tax (compared to +45% capital gains tax from wage income).<br /><br />It therefore seems unlikely to me that the very wealthy would find much advantage in an anonymous currency system for the purpose of avoiding taxation (as they are already able to do that very effectively).  For instance, why would you want to realize $1 in revenue untaxed?  You would want that revenue going to your publicly traded company trading at a 20x P/E multiple.  The 1 dollar in revenue creates $20 in market cap, if you owned 10% of the company, then $1 in revenue to the company is $2 to your share-value at a 20x P/E multiple.  If you own 50%, that $1 is $10 in market cap.<br /><br />You take that $10 in market-cap increase and take a loan against your shares and invest them in 8% corporate bonds...  The advantages to the financial and corporate elite of the existing system, far out weigh the advantages of anonymity (as long as the government and system are stable).<br /><br />Smaller business owners who do not have access to the public market would however find a tax advantage resulting from the unique capacities of digital currency systems.<br /><br />Effectively anonymous monetary systems are developing in Africa (cell phone mediated payment networks).  I think there are reasons that such systems would develop and that we are about 20 years away from some cryptography based monetary systems (there is a strong financial incentiv<wbr />e for smaller countries to provide these services).<br /><br />They really will not change anything however.  Drugs will still come in from Mexico into America.  However, instead of drugs coming from Mexico to America and cash going from America back to Mexico, drugs will go from Mexico to America and cell phone text messages will go from America to Mexico.<br /><br />However, with these monetary systems, even if anonymous; a balance of payments will need to be maintained between entities.  If goods and services are provided in America (drugs) and payment is made to Mexico, the Mexicans will need to be able to purchase goods and services with their payment (presumably to be delivered or consumed in Mexico).  Currently, A provides goods to B and B provides cash to A.  The only difference under unregulated digital currency is that A provides goods/services to B and and B transfers currency to C to be held for A and A transfer currency to D in payment to E for services consumed by A.  Its basically exactly the same as the current cash transactions.<br /><br />In fact, there are few limitations that drug cartels face when using the existing banking system.  Mexican drug cartels have front companies with revenue from drug sales and have been known to purchase capital assets, (such as boats) which are used in the drug business.  For instance, the same boat will end up on a California shore (empty/abandoned, but was full of marijuana or crack-cocaine) and then end up on auctioned by the state, purchased by the same companies and end up back on the shore again.  This can happen 5-8 times for a single boat; it will be seized, determined to have been used for drug transport and then repurchased and seized again several times.<br /><br />The governments have this information and record these transactions, but they do not use the information effectively.  Not much would fundamentally change if governments and law enforcement did not have access to information.  In fact, stronger enforcement or usage of the information which is available would only have the effect of greater concealment by criminal organizations (which has exactly the same effect as adoption of anonymous systems for settling balance of payments from a law enforcement perspective!).  The fundamental issue is border control and the inability of nation states to police their borders against the import of drugs, weapons, immigrants and sex slaves.  If a nation state cannot prevent kidnapping or crime within its borders, it is easy to say &quot;digital currency will make this problem worse&quot;, but the problem is with the nation state losing its monopoly on the use of force within its borders, or the nation state losing the ability to enforce its regulations upon its population or to secure its borders against the import of drugs or weapons.<br /><br />Also, it is likely that the advantages of anonymous digital currency would not be sufficient enough for criminal organizations to abandon the convenience of the existing financial, corporate and legal structures.  For instance, criminals will say &quot;I can get a bank against the income of my front company to finance the purchase of capital assets; but how do I get a bank loan against my anonymous digital currency income?&quot;<br /><br />Without a fully developed modern financial systems around the anonymous digital, it is of limited utility for anything but evading taxes.  It would be almost useless for the purpose of capital flight, unless it was possible to buy bonds or securities while skirting reporting requirements.  You would need a broker dealer willing to do this (hence the system is only feasible if state sponsored by at least one sovereign nation).<br /><br />It is not clear to me that you can security assets or enforce property rights without enforcement by a sovereign nation state.  So maybe you could buy equity in an online digital goods business which receives all payments through anonymous digital currency.  However, how would you audit the books of that business?  Who would enforce the voting rights that your equity ownership entails?<br /><br />You need a system of digital contracts and some advances in secure multi-party computing and<wbr /> cryptographic protocols before you can start developing a shadow finance system on top of the digital currency, which would be independent of right enforced by nation states.  That is still a long ways off.<br /><br />The ownership and transaction structures which would emerge would have to reflect what is enforceable through pr<wbr />otocols and would likely end up being much different than the investment instruments we have in our current system.  Therefore we will likely be seeing a hybrid system, for at-least the next 80 years.<br /><br />For an example of a &#039;hybrid system&#039; that governments are trying to regulate out of existence, look up &quot;hawala&quot;.  The hawala networks rely more on trust and social relationships than cryptography.<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_U6SDl9A_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_544"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#"

any problems useing the current financial system why do they still fly and ship by smugglers highspeed boats bails and bails of 100 dollar bills.<br /><br />The Isreali government understood that about organized crime in there country and in the 1980&#039;s I think date may be wrong but not what I describe. They redesigned there cash and made exchanging old cash for new cash a higly regulated process and did not pre announce what would happen. Thus it was estimated in the press that they were able to confiscate a very large percentage of organized crimes assets. Your system if controlled by a government might make a move like that easier but I think it would do just the opposite. If the US government would simply do that every ten years organized crime would not be anywhere near as profitable.<br /><br />Now as to your proposed system not effecting tax collection you do understand that sales tax and payroll tax are not the only or even majority forms of taxes collected in the US. Income Tax, Property Tax, Corporate Income Tax collect the lion share of taxes paid in the US. Income tax paid by small buisness is a huge percentage of that tax revenue and is precisely were your system would most assuredly make tax avoidance easier. The idea you seem to have that only elites are active in capital markets is also not as black and white as your presentation makes it sound.<br /><br />I stand by my answer that an anonymous e-currency system would; Money laundering, blackmail, extortion, human trafficking, drug sales, tax evasion, fraud, and the complete disruption of markets that depend on transparency, would all be made much easier by a truly anonymous banking system.</p><p class="action_bar"><a class="user" href="/Gary-Stein">Gary Stein</a><span class="bullet"> &bull;

that have nothing to do with currency exchange.  These criminal organisations al<wbr />ready have anonymous currency systems.  They are bulk shipping &quot;stored valued cards&quot; across the boarder and selling them at a 5% discount on markets, to settle balance of payments.  The system is already effectively anonymous for them.<br /><br />Large criminal organizations already have systems in place that accomplish this objective.  The only thing that is change is that the public is gaining access to anonymous banking and it is no longer reserved for governments and organized crime.</p><p class="action_bar"><a class="user" href="/Brandon-Smietana">Brandon Smietana</a><span class="bullet"> &bull;

 What is the probability of that happening in my market?&quot;  If your market is software and 100% margin, you can probably cut back to profitability.  However if you are a manufacturing company with inventory and debt to finance machinery/invento<wbr />ry purchases and your margins are 8%, then a recession could impact your sales enough to put you in a cash crunch.<br /><br />The reality is that your choices about the financing of your company affect your strategic options.  Selling for 10-30 million is easy, there are hundreds of buyers.  Selling for 120 million is more difficult, there will be fewer potential acquires and the company will need to get board approval for the process.  Between 30 million and 300 million valuation is a no-man&#039;s land.  You are too large for an easy M&amp;A but too small to go public.<br /><br />It is even worse to be a technology company with a 300 million valuation (lots of users) and no revenues (Slide, Digg, Ning, link shorteners, etc...).  You cannot IPO because you have no revenues, but your valuation is too high for anyone except Microsoft, Yahoo or Google to buy you.  You only option is taking on more and more VC and hoping that someone big decides to buy you someday.  For these companies, a 30 million dollar &quot;Flickr&quot; type exit early on may be better for the founders and empoyees than growing extremely large without any path to revenue (Foursquare).<br /><br />You want to make the decision whether you will &quot;Go for the Gold&quot; and build the company to IPO or to flip the company early.  You need to make this decision when you start the company, because you will find that different members of the management team will have completely different ideas about the timespan and objectives of company.<br /><br />&quot;<b>the decision to accept VC investment increases the time to exit by approximately 12 years, not the median time of 7 years.&quot;</b><br /><b><br />&quot;</b>When VC investment was added, the <b>time to exit increased to somewhere around sixteen years after the entrepreneurs started and twelve years after the angels invested.&quot;</b><br /><b><br /></b>You need to look at the data and determine what the objectives for your company are and need to make decisions in light of those objectives.  This requires having an early idea of your exit strategy.<br /><br />There are several things you can do to structure your company so that it is more desirable as a target for M&amp;A and those are things you need to do from day one.  They are covered pretty well in that book.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that if you are small company, companies that are interested in acquiring you are not going to magically find you (there are actual companies outside of Silicon Valley that may be interested in your IP, but do not know you exist).  You will have to do some work to get acquired and to find the companies with complementary products.  Getting acquired is not necessary a passive process and there are actions you can take to increase the desirability of your company as an M&amp;A target and to advertise your company to a wider range of potential buyers.<br /><br />Soliciting M&amp;A offers is also necessary to setting up a competitive M&amp;A process. You will also learn that (like fund raising) M&amp;A deals are a full time job.  If you let the CEO manage the M&amp;A process, the company may suffer.  You should have someone who is able to handle the M&amp;A process full-time without affecting the performance of the company during the process.<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_jcZdXje_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_549"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#" id="__w2_cuV9RMq_view_comment_link">1 Comment</a></span><span class="bullet"> &bull; </span><span id="ld_RGxTHo_550"><a class="answer_permalink" href="/How-focused-should-a-start-up-be-on-being-acquired/answer/Brandon-Smietana"><span class="datetime" id="__w2_Dw5lqyJ_datespan">Insert a dynamic date here</span></a><span id="ld_RGxTHo_644"></span></span></div><div id="ld_RGxTHo_551"><div class="comments answer_comments hidden" id="__w2_KPLUyXB_answer_comments"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_645"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_724"><a name="comment_98830"></a><div class="comment p0_5" id="__w2_k29xPDf_comment"><p class="comment_text">Wow. that is an awesome response.

and VC financing events.<br /><br />If you have a profitable bootstrapped business and twenty times the market-share of your VC backed competitor, the VC backed competitor gets all the press coverage in TechCrunch.  They also get all the gossip about boardroom backstabbing and valuations.<br /><br />It is not difficult to make money on the internet, but being a profitable business or a cash cow is not news worthy.  The cashflow businesses tend to be closely held if they would otherwise sell for an earnings multiple less than 20, because the owner would have to find other assets to invest the proceeds of the sale in (such as equities or corporate bonds).  Ad networks and affiliate marketing companies tend to fall into this space.<br /><br />The cashflow businesses are distributed all over the US instead of just being concentrated in one place (like the private equity financed companies).  Cashflow businesses tend to take less VC or no VC.  Online poker or gaming startups and others fall into this category.<br /><br />The reality is that the vast majority of companies receive no private equity investment and companies are generally profitable or bankrupt within 2-3 years.  Only half of companies that IPO have taken early stage private equity investment (as compared to growth equity).<br /><br />You just do not hear about profitable companies, because they have much less drama than &quot;Dude, wheres my revenue model&quot; VC backed companies like Digg, Reddit and Twitter.<br /><br />VCs complain about ad-supported or subscription based companies not being profitable enough, but there is a selection bias, with VCs only ending up with the companies which could not become profitable on 100k daily user and $3/eCPM.  If you are a 3 person company, can build a website and get 500k a year in revenue; you probably do not need private equity investment and you wont be in TechCrunch.<br /><br />News and information flow in Silicon Valley has no relationship with revenue.  That is probably the greatest reason we do not hear about these companies.<br /><br />However, if you are profitable and you go blabbing about, like the creator of Mafia Wars did; people start thinking &quot;This is a good market&quot; and Zynga or someone else comes along and copies your product and buries you.  So if you are making 10k a day in revenues but started your company for the &#039;ePeen&#039; instead of the money, you will go around blabbing about your revenues and end up with 30 &quot;me-too&quot; competitors.  There are selection effects at work.<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_HMDuNGl_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_569"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#" id="__w2_A9s5TM0_view_comment_link">Add Comment</a></span><span class="bullet"> &bull;

alcohol and sex.<br /><br />Zynga was bringing poker to the Facebook platform.  By integrating poker with Facebook&#039;s social network, Zynga made it easier for people to indulge in their sinful gambling impulses by showing them that &quot;all my friends are doing it&quot; with a never-ending stream of notifications spamming yo<wbr />u every time you log in to Facebook.<br /><br />Zynga poker and Farmville notifications are to Facebook what &quot;Herbal Viagra&quot; spam was to email in the early internet.  Zynga was a pioneer of &quot;viral marketing&quot; on the Facebook platform.<br /><br />Zynga was also one of the first companies to successfully package and monetize &quot;ePeen&quot;.  You suck at poker and your friends look down upon you because you only have 150k chips left.  But if you pay Zynga $20 they will sell you 1,000,000 poker chips worth of &quot;I am better than my friends&quot;.<br /><br />Zynga poker and Farmville make people feel like they are accomplishing somethi<wbr />ng with their lives.  That is why they have been successful.<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_AL9P776_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_589"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#" id="__w2_iP8jjj0_view_comment_link">Add Comment</a></span><span class="bullet"> &bull;

 First it is our parents, then it is our teachers, then it is our boss.  We are socialized for the first 25+ years of our life to have someone to please, someone who has power over us, and someone we can defer to.<br /><br />I think the hardest mindset for people who start companies to get out of is that &quot;no one&quot; is in charge now!  *They* are in charge!  There is no one else.  To many it is thilling and liberating.  To others it is scary, isolating, and disorienting.<br /><br />I think that some of the phenomenon that I&#039;ve heard you describe on Quora, where entrepreneurs find VCs, turn over control to them, and act like they &quot;work for&quot; them, is to a large degree an effort to get back to a place of comfort where they don&#039;t ultimately have control, nor complete responsibility.<br /><br />That is also why questions like &quot;what do investors want to see?&quot; and &quot;what will look good on my resume to a future employer&quot; absolutely drive me bonkers.    They are all an effort to return to a comfortable place in the hierarchy where asking what the higher-ups want to see and doing that is way more comfortable than just hanging out there doing what you think is right.</p><p class="action_bar"><a class="user" href="/Michael-Wolfe">Michael Wolfe</a><span class="bullet"> &bull;

but face regulatory challenges.<br /><br />Many of these technologies are just displacing existing technologies; cheaper solar power cannibalizing coal and natural gas power plants; algae biofuels substituting for corn ethanol and oil.  They are merely substitutes for existing commodities.<br /><br />Other areas are completely new markets, such as social gaming.  Roughly I would ask &quot;Is this technology substituting or creating a new market or is a complement of something existing?&quot;.  For instance, algae biofuel substitutes for gasoline (a commodity) where as call center automation technology substitutes hu<wbr />man labor for capital costs.<br /><br />Overall, its a golden age for everything.  Its not just clean-tech or Web 2.0; one does not start where the other ends.  The question about where to put your money to achieve a high rate of return, is more difficult question.  In general, lumping companies by market is not a good way to look at return data.  When someone says &quot;enterprise software is hot&quot;, what they mean is that there are 400 VC backed enterprise software companies and 10 of them are going to produce a great return and 300 of them will go no where.<br /><br />The individual company and where it fits in its market&#039;s value chain is probably more important.<br /><br />It is however interesting that VCs in SV are looking at biotech and clean tech companies.  It would be interesting if SV branched out beyond software and started developing expertise in the physical sciences again (such as occurred when IC production was a hot area).<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_EYR6R6C_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_604"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#" id="__w2_aTN9yAr_view_comment_link">Add Comment</a></span><span class="bullet"> &bull;

Parker was kicked out of three previous companies by his investors and learned this lesson the hard way).<br /><br />Zuckerberg&#039;s success has as much to do with the people around him as it does with any grand choice Zuckerberg made.<br /><br />The one key decision that I think was extremely important and attributed to Zuckerberg alone, is that he chose not to sell to Yahoo for just under a billion dollars.  That decision led Facebook to where it is today.<br /><br />Facebook&#039;s strategy of going from college to college and its brilliant use of network externalities seemed to have been the result of a very small number of intelligent people (ex. Sean Parker, Peter Thiel and Marc Anderson) around Zuckenburg.  Many of facebook&#039;s core strategies (social graph) leverage network externalities (classic Shapiro and Varian) and its not clear to me that Zuckenburg would have even been aware of these strategies, except for the very interesting group of people around him.<br /><br />I think that its very difficult to explain Facebook&#039;s success in terms of a &quot;Great Man&quot; theory, where one person was the critical factor in the critical success of the company.<div class="action_bar" id="__w2_Ml5u7aQ_answer_actions"><span id="ld_RGxTHo_619"><a class="view_comments supp " href="#" id="__w2_otsb9B7_view_comment_link">Add Comment</a></span><span class="bullet"> &bull;

and that should influence your choice to take VC.  If you take VC, the VC has 3 separate ways of blocking an M&amp;A event.  You might like the exit at that valuation and may want to do the M&amp;A and move on, but you cannot; your investors will not approve the deal below 3x return.<br /><br />You may also find yourself with an M&amp;A offer and it seems like the last chance before you run out of money and its a good deal for you, but the VC vetos it and then puts a down-round in the company and wipes out your equity.<br /><br />So you have to ask &quot;What happens to my shares if there is a recession or unforeseen event and the company takes a down-round?  What is the probability of that happening in my market?&quot;  If your market is software and 100% margin, you can probably cut back to profitability.  However if you are a manufacturing company with inventory and debt to finance machinery/invento<wbr />ry purchases and your margins are 8%, then a recession could impact your sales enough to put you in a cash crunch.<br /><br />The reality is that your choices about the financing of your company affect your strategic options.  Selling for 10-30 million is easy, there are hundreds of buyers.  Selling for 120 million is more difficult, there will be fewer potential acquires and the company will need to get board approval for the process.  Between 30 million and 300 million valuation is a no-man&#039;s land.  You are too large for an easy M&amp;A but too small to go public.<br /><br />It is even worse to be a technology company with a 300 million valuation (lots of users) and no revenues (Slide, Digg, Ning, link shorteners, etc...).  You cannot IPO because you have no revenues, but your valuation is too high for anyone except Microsoft, Yahoo or Google to buy you.  You only option is taking on more and more VC and hoping that someone big decides to buy you someday.  For these companies, a 30 million dollar &quot;Flickr&quot; type exit early on may be better for the founders and empoyees than growing extremely large without any path to revenue (Foursquare).<br /><br />You want to make the decision whether you will &quot;Go for the Gold&quot; and build the company to IPO or to flip the company early.  You need to make this decision when you start the company, because you will find that different members of the management team will have completely different ideas about the timespan and objectives of company.<br /><br />&quot;<b>the decision to accept VC investment increases the time to exit by approximately 12 years, not the median time of 7 years.&quot;</b><br /><b><br />&quot;</b>When VC investment was added, the <b>time to exit increased to somewhere around sixteen years after the entrepreneurs started and twelve years after the angels invested.&quot;</b><br /><b><br /></b>You need to look at the data and determine what the objectives for your company are and need to make decisions in light of those objectives.  This requires having an early idea of your exit strategy.<br /><br />There are several things you can do to structure your company so that it is more desirable as a target for M&amp;A and those are things you need to do from day one.  They are covered pretty well in that book.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that if you are small company, companies that are interested in acquiring you are not going to magically find you (there are actual companies outside of Silicon Valley that may be interested in your IP, but do not know you exist).  You will have to do some work to get acquired and to find the companies with complementary products.  Getting acquired is not necessary a passive process and there are actions you can take to increase the desirability of your company as an M&amp;A target and to advertise your company to a wider range of potential buyers.<br /><br />Soliciting M&amp;A offers is also necessary to setting up a competitive M&amp;A process. You will also learn that (like fund raising) M&amp;A deals are a full time job.  If you let the CEO manage the M&amp;A process, the company may suffer.  You should have someone who is able to handle the M&amp;A process full-time without affecting the performance of the company during the process.</div></div></div></div></div><div id="ld_RGxTHo_447"><div class="feed_item stream_feed_item p1 row"><div class="w0_5 e_col"><div class="big_number_stat"><div class="number">11</div><div class="text">Votes</div></div></div><div class="e_col side_col w2"><div class="feed_item_question"><h2><a href="/Why-are-many-people-who-are-very-smart-not-also-rich/answer/Brandon-Smietana">Why are many people who are very smart not also rich?</a></h2></div><div class="inline" id="__w2_TcRh5fW_truncated"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_453"><div class="truncated_thumbnail_holder"></div>&quot;Why are many people who are very smart not also rich?&quot; <a class="more_link" href="#" id="__w2_dz5ipVn_more_link">(more)</a> </div></div><div class="hidden expanded_q_text" id="__w2_TcRh5fW_expanded"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_454">&quot;Why are many people who are very smart not also rich?&quot;<br /><br />The simplest reason is that they are bad at creating wealth.  Even if they create value, they may not be able to capture any of it.<br /><b><br /></b>I have met many intelligent people who have a slave mentality.  They do what they are told.  They want out of life what people tell them they should want.  They believe that money cannot make them happy but also believe women or family can make them happy, or other absurdities you find in popular culture.  They believe socially transmitted notions that are not validated by data and they try to live their lives by them.<br /><br />Most people are also risk adverse.  They would prefer a 80k a year job shuffling paper clips to the chance of success.  I know at least a dozen people who have said &quot;I am going to get a job and then start a company eventually&quot;.  When you ask them &quot;When are you going to start a company?&quot;, they have no definite plans.<br /><br />When you ask them &quot;Why don&#039;t you start a company today?&quot;, they give you the exact reasons why they will not be starting a company in the future.<br /><br />When people do start companies, they usually fail because they give up and decide that it would be easier to go back to their cubical.  This is the number one cause of startup failure.<br /><br />It is much easier for people to do what they are told instead of setting goals for themselves.  Most people have not been in a P&amp;L position where they have to make decisions.  School prepares people for employee positions where the goals are set for you and you just have to do what you are told.<br /><br />Most people are simply unwilling to make sacrifices to become financially succes<wbr />sful or aggressively play politics to  achieve and maintain power within organizations.  The vast majority of people have no plans or meaningful goals in life and those that do are doing nothing to execute on them.<br /><br />You do not generate wealth by accident and people who do not commit to actions that are effective at wealth generation, do not succeed at wealth generation (with the exception of some very lucky early Google and Facebook employees).<br /><br />If you have a slave mentality, you do have little use for assets.  You will come home and watch television, sleep and then go back to work.  Another 40 million is not going to change the television shows you watch.<br /><br />In many ways, a desire for wealth is a desire for freedom.  The reason intelligent people are not wealthy is because they have other desires such as &quot;ePeen&quot;, social status, women or the &quot;desire to belong&quot; and be affirmed by a group.  Each person has a different set of driving motivations and some of these motivations conflict with wealth creation goals.</div></div></div></div></div><div id="ld_RGxTHo_448"><div class="feed_item stream_feed_item p1 row"><div class="w0_5 e_col"><div class="big_number_stat"><div class="number">4</div><div class="text">Votes</div></div></div><div class="e_col side_col w2"><div class="feed_item_question"><h2><a href="/Why-is-Silicon-Valley-so-equity-focused-Are-there-a-lot-of-cashflow-businesses-we-just-dont-know-about/answer/Brandon-Smietana">Why is Silicon Valley so equity focused?

VC backed companies like Digg, Reddit and Twitter.<br /><br />VCs complain about ad-supported or subscription based companies not being profitable enough, but there is a selection bias, with VCs only ending up with the companies which could not become profitable on 100k daily user and $3/eCPM.  If you are a 3 person company, can build a website and get 500k a year in revenue; you probably do not need private equity investment and you wont be in TechCrunch.<br /><br />News and information flow in Silicon Valley has no relationship with revenue.  That is probably the greatest reason we do not hear about these companies.<br /><br />However, if you are profitable and you go blabbing about, like the creator of Mafia Wars did; people start thinking &quot;This is a good market&quot; and Zynga or someone else comes along and copies your product and buries you.  So if you are making 10k a day in revenues but started your company for the &#039;ePeen&#039; instead of the money, you will go around blabbing about your revenues and end up with 30 &quot;me-too&quot; competitors.  There are selection effects at work.</div></div></div></div></div><div id="ld_RGxTHo_449"><div class="feed_item stream_feed_item p1 row"><div class="w0_5 e_col"><div class="big_number_stat"><div class="number">3</div><div class="text">Votes</div></div></div><div class="e_col side_col w2"><div class="feed_item_question"><h2><a href="/Are-Peter-Thiel-and-Vinod-Khosla-right-that-its-the-end-of-Web-2-0-and-the-beginning-of-the-golden-age-of-greentech-and-biotech/answer/Brandon-Smietana">Are Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla right that it&#039;s the end of &quot;Web 2.0&quot;

but face regulatory challenges.<br /><br />Many of these technologies are just displacing existing technologies; cheaper solar power cannibalizing coal and natural gas power plants; algae biofuels substituting for corn ethanol and oil.  They are merely substitutes for existing commodities.<br /><br />Other areas are completely new markets, such as social gaming.  Roughly I would ask &quot;Is this technology substituting or creating a new market or is a complement of something existing?&quot;.  For instance, algae biofuel substitutes for gasoline (a commodity) where as call center automation technology substitutes hu<wbr />man labor for capital costs.<br /><br />Overall, its a golden age for everything.  Its not just clean-tech or Web 2.0; one does not start where the other ends.  The question about where to put your money to achieve a high rate of return, is more difficult question.  In general, lumping companies by market is not a good way to look at return data.  When someone says &quot;enterprise software is hot&quot;, what they mean is that there are 400 VC backed enterprise software companies and 10 of them are going to produce a great return and 300 of them will go no where.<br /><br />The individual company and where it fits in its market&#039;s value chain is probably more important.<br /><br />It is however interesting that VCs in SV are looking at biotech and clean tech companies.  It would be interesting if SV branched out beyond software and started developing expertise in the physical sciences again (such as occurred when IC production was a hot area).</div></div></div></div></div><div id="ld_RGxTHo_450"><div class="feed_item stream_feed_item p1 row"><div class="w0_5 e_col"><div class="big_number_stat"><div class="number">2</div><div class="text">Votes</div></div></div><div class="e_col side_col w2"><div class="feed_item_question"><h2><a href="/What-are-the-implications-of-a-global-banking-system-that-is-completely-anonymous/answer/Brandon-Smietana">What are the implications of a global banking system that is completely anonymous?</a></h2></div><div class="inline" id="__w2_jSTdBZW_truncated"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_459"><div class="truncated_thumbnail_holder"></div>Nothing. <a class="more_link" href="#" id="__w2_DZTFS0h_more_link">(more)</a> </div></div><div class="hidden expanded_q_text" id="__w2_jSTdBZW_expanded"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_460">Nothing.<br /><br />There is already 800 in billion laundered money in banks.  Completely anonymous money is unlikely to change criminal transactions very much.<br /><br />Terrorists and others are using money transfer network such as the hawala or funneling money through non-profits.  The only thing that would change is the government&#039;s ability to monitor the transactions.  Anonymous payment methods may not even affect the government&#039;s ability to effectively monitor these transactions as the government is primarily using network analysis techniques anyways.  The identity of the people do not matter so much as their network of relationships.<br /><br />Government control and can tax the point of sale.  A Walmart could reduce its taxes to the government by not reporting sales and taking money out of the cashdrawer and righting off the sold inventory, but that does not work at scale.  Only small cash businesses such as pizzerias and laundromats are able to do this without suffering fines and retribution by federal government.<br /><br />Bribery would be as easy with anonymous digital currency as it is with cash.  However we would only see kickbacks transition from being informal to formal relationships.  The government&#039;s ability to regulate &#039;political economy&#039; would be decreased.  You could argue whether this is good or bad for the economy.  You could argue that our current system privileges those with political connection<wbr />s and backrub relationships and excludes the masses from participating in the political economy.  Legalized or deniable bribery may increase scrutiny on public offices and subject them to greater monitoring and oversight, which may be a net improvement over the current system of implicit bribes and no transparency or oversight.<br /><br />We are actually better at enforcing payroll tax compliance at large cash businesses like Walmart (where many consumer do not have credit cards and bank accounts) than we are about using oversight to detect and regulate unlawful &#039;political economy&#039; transactions such as bribery.<br /><br />The government also has systems in place for collecting payroll taxes.  These systems are effective, despite the incentive of the employer and employee to lower reported wages (circumventing payroll taxes) and pay the employee directly (&#039;under the table&#039;), circumventing government imposed transaction fees (taxes).  This type of circumvention only happens in small cash businesses, but not at places such as Walmart.<br /><br />As the government controls the point of sale and is able to collect payroll taxes and sales taxes, its likely the the government&#039;s revenue would not be impacted by anonymous currency to a greater extent than it is by the usage of cash.  In fact, the anonymous digital cash transactions may be easier to monitor for the government.  It can mandate businesses use reporting devices and that businesses receive revenue and pay employees from government controlled or approved accounts.  The switch to digital currency and elimination of cash would improve government revenue for these activities, compared to transactions where cash is used.<br /><br />Where the government would lose tax revenue to evasion, is in the provision of online services, digital goods and investment instruments.  Online service providers (PHP programmers from India/China, iPhone application developers, web-designers) can receive revenue anonymously and c<wbr />ircumvent IRS reporting requirements, with the person controlling the account in a position to deny control of the account and avoid recognition of the revenue.  This is however no different than having an online businesses today owned by a bearer bond IBC which has puppet directors in another foreign country and which provides full deniability for the controller of the back accounts of the corporation.  Anonymous banking would only make these transactions easier, although it is harder to imagine that it could possibly be easier to do than it already is, when you consider the existing system.<br /><br />If you are very rich, there are better ways of creating intergenerational wealth and avoiding taxation, which are extremely effective.  For instance, most equity in Israel and many European countries is controlled by a small number of families.  They do not own the companies directly, but have controlling interests in companies which control these companies.   Less than 20 family control about over 30% of the equity in Israel&#039;s public traded companies, through controlling interests.<br /><br />What use is 30 billion dollars if you cannot spend it?  It is much better to have a dual class share structure, where one class of shares has 20 votes to the common share.  A class of shareholders controlling 5% of market-cap controls the company.  Also, no capital gains are paid until shares are sold off.  When they are sold, the seller pays 15% capital gains tax (compared to +45% capital gains tax from wage income).<br /><br />It therefore seems unlikely to me that the very wealthy would find much advantage in an anonymous currency system for the purpose of avoiding taxation (as they are already able to do that very effectively).  For instance, why would you want to realize $1 in revenue untaxed?  You would want that revenue going to your publicly traded company trading at a 20x P/E multiple.  The 1 dollar in revenue creates $20 in market cap, if you owned 10% of the company, then $1 in revenue to the company is $2 to your share-value at a 20x P/E multiple.  If you own 50%, that $1 is $10 in market cap.<br /><br />You take that $10 in market-cap increase and take a loan against your shares and invest them in 8% corporate bonds...  The advantages to the financial and corporate elite of the existing system, far out weigh the advantages of anonymity (as long as the government and system are stable).<br /><br />Smaller business owners who do not have access to the public market would however find a tax advantage resulting from the unique capacities of digital currency systems.<br /><br />Effectively anonymous monetary systems are developing in Africa (cell phone mediated payment networks).  I think there are reasons that such systems would develop and that we are about 20 years away from some cryptography based monetary systems (there is a strong financial incentiv<wbr />e for smaller countries to provide these services).<br /><br />They really will not change anything however.  Drugs will still come in from Mexico into America.  However, instead of drugs coming from Mexico to America and cash going from America back to Mexico, drugs will go from Mexico to America and cell phone text messages will go from America to Mexico.<br /><br />However, with these monetary systems, even if anonymous; a balance of payments will need to be maintained between entities.  If goods and services are provided in America (drugs) and payment is made to Mexico, the Mexicans will need to be able to purchase goods and services with their payment (presumably to be delivered or consumed in Mexico).  Currently, A provides goods to B and B provides cash to A.  The only difference under unregulated digital currency is that A provides goods/services to B and and B transfers currency to C to be held for A and A transfer currency to D in payment to E for services consumed by A.  Its basically exactly the same as the current cash transactions.<br /><br />In fact, there are few limitations that drug cartels face when using the existing banking system.  Mexican drug cartels have front companies with revenue from drug sales and have been known to purchase capital assets, (such as boats) which are used in the drug business.  For instance, the same boat will end up on a California shore (empty/abandoned, but was full of marijuana or crack-cocaine) and then end up on auctioned by the state, purchased by the same companies and end up back on the shore again.  This can happen 5-8 times for a single boat; it will be seized, determined to have been used for drug transport and then repurchased and seized again several times.<br /><br />The governments have this information and record these transactions, but they do not use the information effectively.  Not much would fundamentally change if governments and law enforcement did not have access to information.  In fact, stronger enforcement or usage of the information which is available would only have the effect of greater concealment by criminal organizations (which has exactly the same effect as adoption of anonymous systems for settling balance of payments from a law enforcement perspective!).  The fundamental issue is border control and the inability of nation states to police their borders against the import of drugs, weapons, immigrants and sex slaves.  If a nation state cannot prevent kidnapping or crime within its borders, it is easy to say &quot;digital currency will make this problem worse&quot;, but the problem is with the nation state losing its monopoly on the use of force within its borders, or the nation state losing the ability to enforce its regulations upon its population or to secure its borders against the import of drugs or weapons.<br /><br />Also, it is likely that the advantages of anonymous digital currency would not be sufficient enough for criminal organizations to abandon the convenience of the existing financial, corporate and legal structures.  For instance, criminals will say &quot;I can get a bank against the income of my front company to finance the purchase of capital assets; but how do I get a bank loan against my anonymous digital currency income?&quot;<br /><br />Without a fully developed modern financial systems around the anonymous digital, it is of limited utility for anything but evading taxes.  It would be almost useless for the purpose of capital flight, unless it was possible to buy bonds or securities while skirting reporting requirements.  You would need a broker dealer willing to do this (hence the system is only feasible if state sponsored by at least one sovereign nation).<br /><br />It is not clear to me that you can security assets or enforce property rights without enforcement by a sovereign nation state.  So maybe you could buy equity in an online digital goods business which receives all payments through anonymous digital currency.  However, how would you audit the books of that business?  Who would enforce the voting rights that your equity ownership entails?<br /><br />You need a system of digital contracts and some advances in secure multi-party computing and<wbr /> cryptographic protocols before you can start developing a shadow finance system on top of the digital currency, which would be independent of right enforced by nation states.  That is still a long ways off.<br /><br />The ownership and transaction structures which would emerge would have to reflect what is enforceable through pr<wbr />otocols and would likely end up being much different than the investment instruments we have in our current system.  Therefore we will likely be seeing a hybrid system, for at-least the next 80 years.<br /><br />For an example of a &#039;hybrid system&#039; that governments are trying to regulate out of existence, look up &quot;hawala&quot;.  The hawala networks rely more on trust and social relationships than cryptography.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><div class="contents"><div class="footer_nav row"><div class="e_col footer_links w8"><div id="ld_RGxTHo_440"><ul class="nav_list"><li class="about"><a href="/about">About</a></li><li class="jobs"><a href="/jobs">Jobs</a></li><li class="privacy"><a href="/about/privacy">Privacy</a></li><li class="tos"><a href="/about/tos">Terms</a></li><li class="press"><a href="/press">Press</a></li><li><span class="bullet"> &bull;
